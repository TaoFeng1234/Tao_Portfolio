# Tao's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository contains of projects I have done throughout the years of acadmeic training, self-learning, and voluntary work, etc.

Note: Data used in the projects in this repo is for education and demonstration purposes only.

## About myself

My Data science journey commenced when I first learned about Python. When I was interning for a manufacture company, once I was told to collect as much customer information as possible from a website. My manager told me to do it when I am free since over there are 3000 business names and addresses. 'Copy and paste' is never my way to do things. I did my research and learned about a way to do it in Python. I reached out to my friend, who was majored in CS at college. In just two days, I collected and cleaned up all this business information, handled it over to the CEO of the company and got the first bonus in my professional career. Ever since that, I started helping colleagues around me to 'automate' their repetitive work. I enjoy learning through these Ad-hoc tasks. And later, when I was working as a government consultant for the New York State Government, I realized my interest was and has always been analytics. 

Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Chicago. My coursework and research at the University of Chicago involved multivariate analysis, machine learning algorithms, and matrix computation. My proficiencies in statistical and analytic modeling tools are but are not limited to Matlab, Python, R, and SQL. If you are also a continuous learner and data enthusiast, please connect with me on GitHub, medium or any other platforms. I am looking forward to hearing your stories!

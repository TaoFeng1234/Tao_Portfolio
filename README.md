# Tao's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository contains of projects I have done throughout the years of acadmeic training, self-learning, and voluntary work, etc. Connecct me on Linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/tao-feng-554184a6/ 

Disclaimer: Data used in the projects in this repo is for demonstration purposes only.

  Developed from a coursework project. In this practice, I first compare the performance of below models on a given binary classification task. Then I test how the performance of each of the classifiers varies as the size of the training set increase.

  Observation: The accuracy for each decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost starts at a relatively low rate. The accuracy increases as the size of the training dataset increase. The accuracy for logistic regression, LDA, NB, Neural Network, SVM and Gaussion Processes strats high and did not chance much as the size of the training set increases.
